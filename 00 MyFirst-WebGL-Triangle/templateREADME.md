# Template
Hello, I made this template as a basic setup, it was thrown together relatively quickly while I was learning WebGL.
The code was based off two different instructions for the same task (drawing a basic red triangle),
so the code I made has some elements copied from both. The examples I followed are:
[Class Triangle Example](http://www.cs.uakron.edu/~xiao/graphics/Triangle1.zip),
[Learn WebGL Youtube Tutorial Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2935W76vRNHFpPUuqmLoGCzwx_8eq5yK).
If following the youtube playlist, this file was made by following the first 3 videos, not including the node.js instructions. DISCLAIMER: I do not know WebGL, the purpose of this is to help assist other students with the same learning of WebGL that I am doing.

## Files
This template should include this readme + 2 other files: template.html, and template.js
