# Archival Note
This isn't a project I'm actively working on, and if I ever pick it up again then I'll probably start from scratch.
I'm keeping this available as reference / learning material, I hope it's useful. :)

# My-WebGL-Learning
This is the code for my first WebGL learning. At this time I do not know WebGL and "MyFirst-WebGL-Triangle" is the first functional thing I have completed involving it.
I've also had no prior experience with HTML, JavaScript, or GLSL, so it was a dive on the deep-end.
