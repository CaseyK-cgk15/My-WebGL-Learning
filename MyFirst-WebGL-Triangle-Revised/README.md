# MyFirst WebGL Triangle (Revised)

## Changes from first version:
- GLSL code for vertex and fragment shaders is now in an HTML script tag instead of a JS string
- Code has been reorganized with functions to be more readable
- Creation of Shaders and Program have been turned into functions, these functions were put in a seperate file to make them usable for more projects
- I made the triangle a different shape and size, I was just following [WebGL Fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-fundamentals.html)
